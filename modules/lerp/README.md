#About

A quote from CSS transforms specification (30 November 2017):
```
CSS is a language for describing **the rendering** of structured documents
(such as HTML and XML) on screen, on paper, in speech, etc.
```
So, to control the rendering, this is, **The Rendering Engine** driven by JavaScript.
It will work in modern browsers only.
